# IronAI Fitness - Installation Guide

This is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**. It behaves like a native Windows or Android app but runs on web technologies.

## How to Run (Local Development)
Because this app uses ES Modules and Service Workers, you cannot simply double-click `index.html`. You must serve it via a local web server.

### Option 1: Using VS Code (Easiest)
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code.
2. Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

### Option 2: Using Node.js
1. Open your terminal in this folder.
2. Run `npx serve .`
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## How to Install on Windows
1. Open the app in **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge**.
2. Look at the address bar (URL bar) at the top.
3. Click the **Install Icon** (Computer screen with a down arrow, or a Plus sign).
4. Click **Install**.
5. The app will now launch in its own window and appear in your Start Menu.

## How to Install on Android
1. Open the app in **Chrome**.
2. Tap the menu (three dots).
3. Tap **"Add to Home Screen"** or **"Install App"**.
